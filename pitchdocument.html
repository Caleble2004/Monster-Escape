        <h2>Development Timeline</h2>
        <p> The process in creating a game for Monster Escape is to start with a mobile game pitch where you start putting ideas, drawing out the layout of the mobile game concepts, and also  using the core mechanics for the game's control panels and also adding the UI, the assets, adding sprites for the characters enemies, items, obstacles, a boss enemy, adding animation, adding health either damage or healing, and also adding different background for each level. Then after I begin setting up Flow Lab and begin starting off with the game's environments, flow lab's built in codes, animation for the character, creating a scroll camera, and adding UI for the health bar and the coins collected for the first level. Then changing the assets for the background, the player, adding the boss enemy, adding more levels, and adding the main menu.</p>
