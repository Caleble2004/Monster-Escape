        <h2>Concept & core Gameplay</h2>
        <p>For Future Hero mobile game the core concept is to ensure that the mobile game makes it a lot fun and engaging the users to come back to playing my own mobile game. I believe that the innovation gameplay, art style, narrative, multiplayer, and accessibility would make the mobile game unique. For the gameplay mechanics for Future Hero is action-based challenges in which the player can interact the environment rapidly and move around left or right in a 2d environment until the player reach the goal at the end of each levels and defeat bosses at the end of the level of the world section the player is at. The game’s genre for Future Hero is a platform and action game in which the game involves the player to run around, jump, and navigating levels.</p>
