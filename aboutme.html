        <h2>About the Developer</h2>
        <p>Hello, my name is Caleb Le, and I am an aspiring game developer who enjoys making interactive gameplay. Behind the game project that I'm making is to make the game more fun, and the game also uses creative pixelated art to make it more arcade-like. My goals in working on this project are to make the game more creative and more challenging by adding more levels to the game. I believe that the 2d platformer games Lep's World 2 and Lep's World 3 inspire me in making these projects to make the game more fun and in a creative way. This project will help me contribute to my goals in making a game where many users and players will remember.</p>
